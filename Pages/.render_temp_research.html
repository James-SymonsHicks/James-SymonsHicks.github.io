However, the factors that drive retail investors to focus on particular stocks are unclear. Using a sample of UK FTSE 100 stocks, this paper analyses whether stock volatility, liquidity, returns, and trading volume have the power to attract the attention of UK retail investors, measured using the Google Search Volume Index. Overall, this paper finds positive relationships between three of the dynamics (volatility, returns, and daily trading volume) and increased retail investor attention. Greater stock illiquidity also coincides with an increase in the Google Search Volume Index, although this may be due to liquidity-impacting events. When conditioning on stocks by quartiles of market capitalisation, I find that the effects of returns and trading volume are greater in magnitude for the top 25% of stocks.  </p></li>

Securities.</b> <i> UCL MSc Economics Dissertation.</i> [<a href="mailto:james.symons-hicks.20@ucl.ac.uk">pdf available on request</a>]
<p> <b>Abstract:</b> This paper explores algorithmic pricing in a multi-period market microstructure model using a Q-learning algorithm. We focus on how these algorithms respond to the risk posed by a stochastic asset value. In the baseline Q-learning model, the algorithms behave as if loss averse, leading to quotes only at loss-free prices. We consider a series of Q-learning algorithms to investigate the conditions under which these market makers will trade at competitive levels. Using `Imperfect Counterfactual Updating', we show that Algorithmic Market Makers set prices close to competitive levels. In the presence of actions that are both profitable and risk-free for market makers, we find that counterfactual updating is sufficient for trade to occur at competitive levels; when these actions are removed, the algorithms require counterfactual updating and additional exploration to ensure trade. We find that this price-setting behaviour is caused by these algorithms wanting to avoid losses, rather than through profit-seeking collusion.  </p> </li>
